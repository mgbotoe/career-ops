# Shared Context -- career-ops

<!-- ============================================================
     HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THIS FILE
     ============================================================
     This file contains the shared context for all career-ops modes.
     Before using career-ops, you MUST:
     1. Fill in config/profile.yml with your personal data
     2. Create your cv.md in the project root
     3. (Optional) Create article-digest.md with your proof points
     4. Customize the sections below marked with [CUSTOMIZE]
     ============================================================ -->

## Sources of Truth (ALWAYS read before evaluating)

| File | Path | When |
|------|------|------|
| cv.md | `cv.md` (project root) | ALWAYS |
| article-digest.md | `article-digest.md` (if exists) | ALWAYS (detailed proof points) |
| profile.yml | `config/profile.yml` | ALWAYS (candidate identity and targets) |

**RULE: NEVER hardcode metrics from proof points.** Read them from cv.md + article-digest.md at evaluation time.
**RULE: For article/project metrics, article-digest.md takes precedence over cv.md** (cv.md may have older numbers).

## North Star -- Target Roles

The skill applies with EQUAL rigor to ALL target roles. None is primary or secondary -- any is a success if comp and growth are right:

| Archetype | Thematic axes | What they buy |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Staff AI Product Manager** | Enterprise AI, LLMs, RAG, Copilot, PRDs, roadmaps, business cases | Someone who owns AI product strategy end-to-end with $100M+ portfolio experience |
| **Director of AI Strategy** | AI adoption, ROI modeling, executive alignment, org enablement | Someone who builds the AI playbook for the enterprise and drives measurable outcomes |
| **Head of AI Enablement** | Change management, Copilot rollouts, training, adoption metrics | Someone who makes AI actually work across 500+ person organizations |
| **Senior AI Product Manager (Enterprise)** | GenAI/Agents, discovery, delivery, stakeholder mgmt | Someone who translates business problems into shipped AI products |
| **AI Solutions Architect** | System design, integrations, enterprise-ready, healthcare/life sciences | Someone who designs end-to-end AI architectures with regulatory credibility |
| **AI Transformation Lead** | Digital transformation, pricing, operations, McKinsey-style rigor | Someone who leads AI transformation with measurable P&L impact |

### Adaptive Framing by Archetype

> **Concrete metrics: read from `cv.md` + `article-digest.md` at evaluation time. NEVER hardcode numbers here.**

| If the role is... | Emphasize about the candidate... | Proof point sources |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Staff AI PM | $156M portfolio, enterprise AI ownership (LLMs, RAG, Copilot, multi-agent), $55M pipeline built at Beckman Coulter | cv.md + article-digest.md |
| Director of AI Strategy | $51-71M pricing transformation with McKinsey, AI strategy across 3 Danaher OpCos, board-level communication | cv.md + article-digest.md |
| Head of AI Enablement | Copilot deployment to 500+ HRBPs, $4.3M productivity savings, change management at enterprise scale | cv.md + article-digest.md |
| Senior AI PM (Enterprise) | Product discovery, regulatory credibility (FDA, ISO 13485), healthcare AI from UCSF to Danaher | cv.md + article-digest.md |
| Solutions Architect | End-to-end system design, EHR integration (CM-SHARE), clinical informatics, enterprise AI architecture | cv.md + article-digest.md |
| AI Transformation Lead | P&L impact ($51-71M), McKinsey partnership, cross-OpCo transformation, FDA cybersecurity delivery | cv.md + article-digest.md |

### Exit Narrative (use in ALL framings)

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Replace with YOUR narrative. Examples:
     - "Built and sold my SaaS after 5 years. Now focused on applied AI at scale."
     - "Led engineering at a Series B startup through 10x growth. Now seeking my next challenge."
     - "Transitioned from consulting to building product. Looking for high-ownership roles."
     Read from config/profile.yml → narrative.exit_story -->

Use the candidate's exit story from `config/profile.yml` to frame ALL content:
- **In PDF Summaries:** Bridge from past to future -- "Now applying the same [skill] to [JD domain]."
- **In STAR stories:** Reference proof points from article-digest.md
- **In Draft Answers (Section G):** The transition narrative should appear in the first response.
- **When the JD asks for "entrepreneurial", "ownership", "builder", "end-to-end":** This is the #1 differentiator. Increase match weight.

### Cross-cutting Advantage

Frame profile as **"Enterprise AI leader with clinical roots and P&L impact"** that adapts framing to the role:
- For Staff AI PM: "product leader who owns the full arc from strategy to shipped AI -- $156M portfolio, 110% revenue targets"
- For Director of AI Strategy: "strategist who partners with McKinsey and drives $51-71M transformations across multiple business units"
- For Head of AI Enablement: "enablement leader who deploys AI to 500+ users with measurable ROI ($4.3M savings)"
- For AI Solutions Architect: "architect with clinical depth (UCSF, Sutter) and regulatory credibility (FDA, ISO 13485)"
- For AI Transformation Lead: "transformation driver who delivers early (FDA cybersecurity 2 months ahead) and at scale (3 OpCos)"

Convert "clinical roots" into a strategic differentiator -- rare domain depth that most AI PMs lack. Peer-reviewed publications (JMIR, Nature) and WSJ feature provide external validation.

### Portfolio as Proof Point (use in high-value applications)

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] If you have a live demo, dashboard, or public project, configure it here.
     Example:
     dashboard:
       url: "https://yoursite.dev/demo"
       password: "demo-2026"
       when_to_share: "LLMOps, AI Platform, observability roles"
     Read from config/profile.yml → narrative.proof_points and narrative.dashboard -->

If the candidate has a live demo/dashboard (check profile.yml), offer access in applications for relevant roles.

### Comp Intelligence

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Research comp ranges for YOUR target roles and update these ranges -->

**General guidance:**
- Use WebSearch for current market data (Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Blind)
- Frame by role title, not by skills -- titles determine comp bands
- Contractor rates are typically 30-50% higher than employee base to account for benefits
- Geographic arbitrage works for remote roles: lower CoL = better net

### Negotiation Scripts

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Adapt these to your situation -->

**Salary expectations (general framework):**
> "Based on market data for this role, I'm targeting [RANGE from profile.yml]. I'm flexible on structure -- what matters is the total package and the opportunity."

**Geographic discount pushback:**
> "The roles I'm competitive for are output-based, not location-based. My track record doesn't change based on postal code."

**When offered below target:**
> "I'm comparing with opportunities in the [higher range]. I'm drawn to [company] because of [reason]. Can we explore [target]?"

### Location Policy

<!-- [CUSTOMIZE] Adapt to your situation. Read from config/profile.yml → location -->

**In forms:**
- Binary "can you be on-site?" questions: follow your actual availability from profile.yml
- In free-text fields: specify your timezone overlap and availability

**In evaluations (scoring):**
- Remote dimension for hybrid outside your country: score **3.0** (not 1.0)
- Only score 1.0 if JD explicitly says "must be on-site 4-5 days/week, no exceptions"

### Time-to-offer priority
- Working demo + metrics > perfection
- Apply sooner > learn more
- 80/20 approach, timebox everything

## Global Rules

### NEVER

1. Invent experience or metrics
2. Modify cv.md or portfolio files
3. Submit applications on behalf of the candidate
4. Share phone number in generated messages
5. Recommend comp below market rate
6. Generate a PDF without reading the JD first
7. Use corporate-speak
8. Ignore the tracker (every evaluated offer gets registered)

### ALWAYS

0. **Cover letter:** If the form has an option to attach or write a cover letter, ALWAYS include one. Generate PDF with the same visual design as the CV. Content: JD quotes mapped to proof points, links to relevant case studies. 1 page max.
1. Read cv.md and article-digest.md (if exists) before evaluating any offer
1b. **First evaluation of each session:** Run `node cv-sync-check.mjs` with Bash. If it reports warnings, notify the candidate before continuing
2. Detect the role archetype and adapt framing
3. Cite exact lines from CV when matching
4. Use WebSearch for comp and company data
5. Register in tracker after evaluating
6. Generate content in the language of the JD (EN default)
7. Be direct and actionable -- no fluff
8. When generating English text (PDF summaries, bullets, LinkedIn messages, STAR stories): native tech English, not translated. Short sentences, action verbs, no unnecessary passive voice.
8b. **Case study URLs in PDF Professional Summary:** If the PDF mentions case studies or demos, URLs MUST appear in the first paragraph (Professional Summary). The recruiter may only read the summary. All URLs with `white-space: nowrap` in HTML.
9. **Tracker additions as TSV** -- NEVER edit applications.md to add new entries. Write TSV in `batch/tracker-additions/` and `merge-tracker.mjs` handles the merge.
10. **Include `**URL:**` in every report header** -- between Score and PDF.

### Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| WebSearch | Comp research, trends, company culture, LinkedIn contacts, fallback for JDs |
| WebFetch | Fallback for extracting JDs from static pages |
| Playwright | Verify if offers are still active (browser_navigate + browser_snapshot), extract JDs from SPAs. **CRITICAL: NEVER launch 2+ agents with Playwright in parallel -- they share a single browser instance.** |
| Read | cv.md, article-digest.md, cv-template.html |
| Write | Temporary HTML for PDF, applications.md, reports .md |
| Edit | Update tracker |
| Bash | `node generate-pdf.mjs` |
